Distribution formulas are intented for use in multi-branch systems to specify the number of copies that should be 
distributed to specific branches. 

The formulas are also used for all libraries as line item templates with the batch updater on purchase orders. Formulas 
can be created and reused as needed.

. Choose a formula owner. The formula owner indicates the organizational units whose staff can use this formula.
. Create your distribution formula/line item template using a combination of the following fields:
+
** *Owning Library*
** *Shelving Location*
** *Fund*
** *Circ Modifier*

+
. On the pop up you can add a new entry, edit an existing entry, or delete an existing entry using the 
trash can icon.
. Use the arrows to re-order the entries.
.. When using a distribution formula the system will start at the top of the list and work down the list until it runs out of items. 
For example, if you are ordering five copies of a title and you apply a distribution formula with entries for 
seven branches (1 item each), only the first five branches will receive items.
