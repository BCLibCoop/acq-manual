NOTE: Currently EDI for Sitka Evergreen has been set up to be used with the following providers:
* CVS
* United Library Services ULS

Standard Address Number (SAN)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Standard Address Number (SAN) is a unique 7 digit number that identifies your library. Please contact Sitka Support if your library does not already have a SAN.

For EDI to work your library must have a SAN and each of your providers must supply you with their SAN.

Library SAN

Your Library SAN is stored in your Org Unit settings.

A Standard Address Number (SAN) is a unique 7 digit number that identifies your library. Please contact Sitka Support if your library does not already have a SAN.
