[NOTE]
======
A default claim policy can be associated with a provider and is then automatically assigned to line items 
and copies purchased from that provider.

See xref:_providers[] for the steps to add a default claim policy.

Claim Types
^^^^^^^^^^^
(((claim types)))

Claim types are used in the claiming process to indicate why an item needs to be claimed.

The following claim types have been set up for the consortium:

* PAST DUE - Item has not yet arrived.
* DAMAGED - Item received damaged.
* SHORT SHIPPED - Invoice says shipped, but item not in box.
* INCORRECT - Incorrect item has been received.
* DUPLICATE - Item has already been received.

Library staff can create additional claim types by clicking *New Claim Types* on the 
*Claim Types* tab.
