(((Search)))

General Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Acquisitions Search interface provides a centralized place for searching Line Items, Purchase Orders, Invoices, and Selection Lists.

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *General Search*.

Line Items Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Acquisitions Search interface defaults to the Line Items Search tab. Here you can search across the entire acquisitions module (selection lists, purchase orders, and invoices) to find line items matching your search terms. There is not an initial default search for this tab. Users must create their search or set a default line item search.

. Select your search field(s) and enter your search term(s).
. Click *Search*

.Search Tips
* To search for line items using non-library specific search fields, such as _LI - State_, you must also use a library specific search field such as _PO - Ordering Agency_ to restrict the search to your library.

Purchase Orders Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Purchase Orders Search tab allows you to conduct a search of Purchase Orders. The default search that appears when the tab is viewed is a search for all purchase orders that are in the status of on order at your library:

.Search for On-Order purchase orders
. Purchase Order - Ordering Agency is [your library]
. Purchase Order - Status is [On-Order]
. Click *Search*.

You can construct a new one-time search instead of using the default search or set a default purchase order search that will replace the default search described above. If a user sets a new default Purchase Orders search, that search will be populated automatically when Acquisitions → Purchase Orders is selected from the main menu.

anchor:pending-order[pending purchase orders]

You can modify the default purchase order search to generate a list of pending purchase orders.

.Search for Pending purchase orders
. *Acquisitions* -> *Purchase Orders*
. Purchase Order - Ordering Agency is [your library]
. Purchase Order - Status is [Pending]
. Click *Search*.

Search for Selection Lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Selection Lists Search tab allows you to conduct a search of selections lists. The default search that appears when the tab is viewed is a search for all selection lists owned by the currently logged in user.

.Search for your Selection Lists
. Selection List - Owner is [currently logged in user]
. Click *Search*.

Creating a New Default Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In each of the Acquisitions Search tabs you can create a custom default search that will override the standard default search for the tab.

.Create a new default search
. Construct your custom search using the drop down menus in the selected search tab.
.. Click the (+) to add a new field to your search and click the (-) to remove a field from your search.
. Click the blue button that says Set As Default [Line Item/Purchase Order/Invoice/Selection List] Search.
.. You will see a green message in the lower right hand corner confirming that your default search was saved.
. This search will now load each time you view the selected tab and will override the default search listed above.

There is also an option to automatically execute the search when the tab is opened, eliminating the need to click the Search button. This can be done by checking the box to Retrieve Results Immediately and then clicking the Set As Default …​ Search button.

Both the custom default search and the selection to retrieve results immediately are saved to the workstation.

If you wish to reset a search tab to its defaults, click the Reset Default Search button.

Search Syntax and Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To create your search, choose if your search should match _all_ or _any_ of the search terms you use in your search. Selecting _all_ will conduct a stricter search that must match all of the search terms you indicate. Selecting _any_ will return search results that match any of the search terms you indicate.

Next, select a search attribute from the drop down menu. This menu provides search options related to line items, purchase orders, selection lists, and invoices; the search results will return relevant line items.

The search entry box will display a controlled list of values via a dropdown menu when available. You will see this when searching for an org unit, owner, state, status, and provider, among others. Search is case-insensitive.

.Search Tips
. Search operators that are not applicable to the search term selected will not appear in the operator drop down menu when creating a new search. Only relevant search operators will display as options.
. Fields that are associated with controlled vocabularies will display the controlled values in both the search terms and filters for easy selection. These fields include:
. Column headers for the search results can be clicked on to sort the results by the column. The columns will sort alphabetically or by other sort criteria as appropriate for the data type.
. Using the column actions to filter or sort search results will execute a new search using the current search parameters. If any un-executed changes are made to the search parameters between the initial search submission and any changes to the filters, the new search parameters will be executed upon filtering.
