Workflow: Blanket Orders
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Sitka's Blanket Order workflow
NOTE: This workflow should be followed by libraries that want to track money spent on Blanket Orders. This workflow The work flow supported by this development assumes staff does not need to track the individual contents of the order, only the amounts encumbered and invoiced in bulk.

Blanket orders allow staff to invoice an encumbered amount multiple times, paying off the charge over a period of time.
