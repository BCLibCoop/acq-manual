(((load MARC order records, acq import error)))
(((acq import error)))

When loading records via the *Load MARC Order Records* screen you may occassionally encounter 
the _ACQ IMPORT ERROR_.

This error is usually caused by discrepancies between the holdings information supplied by the vendor 
in the 970 field of the MARC record and the information in Evergreen.  

If you update your shelving location names or fund codes in Evergreen make sure to let your vendors know
about the changes so they can update their templates as well.
