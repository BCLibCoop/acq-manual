Delaying a Purchase Order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If something happens to delay an entire order, such as a shipment is lost, the purchase 
order can be delayed in Evergreen.  This enables you to track what is going on with the 
order while still indicating that the order is expected to arrive eventually.

To delay an entire purchase orders all line items must have the 
status of on-order.  If you need to delay just particular line items 
see xref:_delaying_a_line_item[].

[NOTE]
======
Delaying a purchase order uses the same functionality as canceling it. The crucial 
difference is the cancel reason used.  When delaying purchase orders you must select a 
cancel reason prefaced with Delayed. See xref:_cancel_reasons[] for a full list.
======

. Open the purchase order you wish to delay.
. Click *Cancel Order*.
