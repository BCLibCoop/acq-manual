At the end of each fiscal year libraries need to run year end processes to close out the year.

Year End Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries should review this checklist as they reach the end of their fiscal year in preparation for the year end processes.

* Activate all pending purchase orders.

** Search for xref:pending-order[].

* Run report *Lines Items That Have Been Invoiced but not Received*.

** Template found in Sitka_templates -> Acquisitions -> Line Items

* Mark as received all items physically received in the current fiscal year.

** See xref:_receive_line_items[].

Fiscal Year Close-out Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Year End Close-out Operation allows you to deactivate funds for the current year and create analogous
funds for the next year. It transfers encumbrances to the analogous funds. Depending on the needs of a
library it can also transfer any remaining money into the analogous funds or back to the original
funding sources.

Choose *ONE* of the following options for Fiscal Year Close-out

. xref:propagation-only[] - Create analogous funds for the next year.

. xref:rollover-encumbrance-only[] - Create analogous funds for the next year and rollover encumbrances.  Unspent money is returned to the funding source.

. xref:rollover-encumbrances-and-unspent-money[] - Create analogous funds for the next year and rollover encumbrances and unspent money.

. xref:rollover-encumbrances-and-unspent-money-for-specific-funds[] - Create analogous funds for the next year and rollover encumbrances and unspent money for some funds and only encumbrances for other funds.
