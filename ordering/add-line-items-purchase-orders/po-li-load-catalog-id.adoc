Via Load Catalog Record IDs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[[_po_li_via_load_catalog_record_ids]]

The Load Catalog Record IDs function enables you to create line items from a list of catalogue records whose record IDs are saved in a CSV file. This is useful if you want to batch order copies of items that your organization already owns. For example, you run a copy/hold ratio report to identify how many copies you have available compared to the number of holds that are on your Hot Fiction display. You decided that you want to order an extra copy of six titles. Your copy/hold ration report includes the record ID of each title. You can save the record IDs into a CSV file, upload the file into Evergreen, and create a purchase order for the items. If you only want to order additional copies of one title then using View/Place Orders is faster.

. Create a CSV file with the record ID of each catalogue record in the first column of the spreadsheet. You can create this CSV file from a spreadsheet generated by a report, as suggested in the aforementioned example. You can also copy and paste record IDs from the catalogue record into the CSV file.
. Save the CSV file to your computer.
. In Evergreen, select *Acquisitions* -> *Load Catalog Record IDs*.
. Click *Load More Terms*.
. Locate the desired file and click *Open*.
.. The screen will display the number of terms (record IDs) that have been loaded. Clicking Load more terms again will allow you to load an additional file of record IDs.
. Click *Retrieve Records*.
.. The records will appear as line items.
. Add the line item to an existing Purchase Order by checking the box adjacent 
to the desired line item(s) and selecting *Actions* â†’ *Add to Purchase Order*.
.. In the pop up box that appears enter the name of the purchase order you wish 
to add the line item to.

NOTE: Record IDs are auto-generated digits associated with each record. They are 
found in the Record Summary that appears at the top of each record in the catalogue.
