New Features in Evergreen Acquisitions Version 3.9
--------------------------------------------------

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The acquisitions administration interfaces have been updated and in some cases consolidated.

* The four claiming interfaces have been consolidated into one tabbed interface.
* Currencies and exchange rates are now a single interface, making it easier for Co-op Support to manage
exchange rates for different currencies for libraries.
* The distribution forumula interface has been re-designed.
* Funding sources, funds, and fund tags have been re-designed and consolidated into a tabbed Fund Administration 
interface.
* Funding sources now have an active flag so you can mark funding sources that are no longer in use as 
in-active.
