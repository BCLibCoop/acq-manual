Fund Administration
-------------------

Funding Sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the funding sources interface you can create funding sources, allocate credit to funding sources, and 
apply credit to funds. Funding sources allow you to specify the sources that contribute monies to 
your fund(s), such as your municipal government, grants, and donations. You can create as few or as 
many funding sources as you need.

[TIP]
=====
Funding sources are not tied to fiscal or calendar years, but since any unspent money is returned to 
the funding source during the year end process Co-op Support recommends that you create new funding sources 
for each year and de-active funding sources when they are no longer in use. To distinguish the funding 
sources from year to year, best practice is to include the year in the funding source name and code. 
For example, City of Fiction 2022 and COF2022.

Editing a Funding Source
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[NOTE]
======
While you are able to edit your funding source's name, owner, code, currency, and active flag, you are unable 
to edit the balance of your funding source. The balance of a funding source can only be altered 
by applying credit to the funding source or allocating credit from the funding source to a fund.
======

. Select the *Funding Sources* tab.
.. By default Evergreen filters so that only active funding sources display.

. Make your changes and click *Save*.
+
image::images/administration/funding-source-5.png[]

[CAUTION]
=========
Editing the currency of an active in use funding source is not recommended as it can have 
serious consequences.

Applying Credit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[CAUTION]
=========
A funding source with credit applied cannot be deleted. 

Ensure you apply the correct amount of credit to each funding source as there is no way in the 
staff client to edit the amount applied. In the event that an incorrect amount is allocated to 
a funding source please submit a ticket to xref:https://bc.libraries.coop/support/[Co-op Support] and include
the name of the funding source and the incorrect amount that has been allocated.

Funds
~~~~~

Funds should be created for every budget you wish to track. For some libraries this may be a fund per 
individual collection; other libraries may only use one fund for all purchasing. Libraries may want to 
create funds specifically for non-bibliographic purchases, such as processing supplies, or for 
other charges such as charges for MARC records.

Multi-branch libraries may have a single set of funds for their entire system, a set of 
funds for each branch, or may use a combination of funds at the branch and system levels.

Creating Funds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[NOTE]
======
Funds should be created when your library first starts using acquisitions and when you want to track a new
budget.  Funds for subsequent fiscal years are created automatically by Evergreen during the year end processes.
======

. Go to *Administration* -> *Acquisitions Administration* -> *Fund Administration*.
. Select the *Funds* tab.
+
image::images/administration/funds-create-1.png[]
+
. Click *New Fund*.
+
image::images/administration/funds-create-2.png[]
+
. Enter a name for the fund. There is no limit to the number of characters that can be entered in this field.
. Create a unique code for the fund. 
.. Please add your library short code to the end of all fund codes. For example, AF_MPL
. Enter a year for the fund. This can be a fiscal year or a calendar year. The format of the year is YYYY.
. The fund owner will default to your workstation. 
.. In a multi-branch system funds may be set to the top organizational unit, the organizational 
units for branches, or a combination.
. The fund will be _Active_ by default. You cannot make purchases from an inactive fund.
. Select a currency type from the drop down menu. When a fund is applied to a line item or copy the 
price of the item will be encumbered in the currency associated with the fund.
. Check the propagate box if you will want to propagate this fund. When you propagate a fund, Evergreen 
creates a new fund for the following fiscal year with the same parameters as your current fund. All of the 
settings transfer except for the year and the amount of money in the fund. Propagation occurs 
during the fiscal year close-out operation.
. Check the Rollover box if you would like to roll over remaining funds and/or encumbrances 
during the fiscal year close-out operation into the same fund for the next year.
. Optionally, enter a Balance Stop Percent. The balance stop percent prevents you from making purchases 
when only a specified amount of the fund remains. For example, if you want the fund to stop purchases 
after 95% of the fund has been spent, then you would enter 95 in the field. When the fund reaches 
its balance stop percent, it will appear in red when you apply funds to line items.
.. If this field is left blank it is possible to overspend the fund.
.. The balance stop percent can be adjusted as needed throughout your fiscal year.
. Optionally, enter a balance warning percent. The balance warning percent gives you a warning that 
the fund is low. You can specify any percent. For example, if you want to be warned when 50% of the 
fund has been spent, then you would enter 50 in the field. When the fund reaches its balance warning percent, 
it will appear in yellow when you apply funds to line items.
.. The Balance Warning Percent can be adjusted as needed throughout your fiscal year.
. Click Save.
+
image::images/administration/funds-create-3.png[]
+
. Your fund will be created. Repeat this process to create additional funds.


Editing a Fund
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[CAUTION]
=========

by allocating monies to the fund or transferring monies to another fund.
=========

. Go to *Administration* -> *Acquisitions Administration* -> *Fund Administration*.
. Select the *Funds* tab.
. Double-click on the row you would like to edit. A pop-up box will appear in which you can edit the fields.
. Make your changes and click *Save*.
+
image::images/administration/funds-edit-1.png[]
+
. Your fund will be updated.

[CAUTION]
=========
If you load vendor records make sure you let your vendors know about any changes you make to 
fund codes that are used in their templates.  If the fund code doesn't match between Evergreen and the 
$f in the templates your MARC records will not load.
