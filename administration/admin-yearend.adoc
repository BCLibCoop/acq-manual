Sitka's Evergreen Acquisitions Video - Fiscal Year Start (New Year) (5:33)

At the end of each fiscal year libraries need to run year end processes to close out the year.

Year End Checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Libraries should review this checklist as they reach the end of their fiscal year in preparation for the year end processes.

* Activate all pending purchase orders.

** Search for xref:pending-order[].

* Run report *Lines Items That Have Been Invoiced but not Received*.

** Template found in Sitka_templates -> Acquisitions -> Line Items

* Mark as received all items physically received in the current fiscal year.

** See xref:_receive_line_items[].

* Invoice all items to be paid for in the current fiscal year.

** See xref:_invoices[]

* Save and Close all open invoices.

** See xref:_search_for_invoices[].

* Run report *Lines Items That Have Been Received but not Invoiced*.

** Template found in Sitka_templates -> Acquisitions -> Line Items

* Verify the Funding Sources do not have a negative balance.

** See xref:_funding_sources[]

* Choose a date to run the year end process.

** Libraries should *NOT* run year end between 9:30am and 11:00am PT as EDI invoices are retrieved by the system system during this period every morning.

* Implement an acquisitions year end freeze.

** New orders should not be created while you are preparing for Year End.
