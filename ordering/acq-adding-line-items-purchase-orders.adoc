Adding Line Items to Purchase Orders
------------------------------------

Individual line items can be added to an existing pending purchase order in four ways:

* via a Brief Record
* via the View/Place Orders interface
* via the Load Catalog Record IDs interface
* via the MARC Federated Search interface

These options are used with providers that do not supply MARC record files.
