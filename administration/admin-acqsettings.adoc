Acquisitions Settings in the Library Settings Editor
----------------------------------------------------
(((library settings)))
(((administration, library settings)))


Several settings in the 
http://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_library_settings_editor.html[Library Settings 
Editor] pertain to functions specific to the 
Acquisitions Module. They have been grouped into three categories:

* xref:_acquisitions_settings_general[Acquisitions Settings - General]
* xref:_acquisitions_settings_load_MARC_order_record_defaults[Acquisitions Settings - 
Load MARC Order Records Defaults]
* xref:_acquisitions_settings_load_MARC_order_record_defaults_not_in_use[Acquisitions 
Settings - Load MARC Order Records Defaults Not in Use]

To update these settings go to *Administration → Local Administration → 
Library Settings Editor*. You must have both local system administrator and 
acquisitions administration permissions.
