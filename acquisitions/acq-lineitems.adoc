Line Items
----------

Line items represent bibliographic records on a selection list or purchase order. Line items contain attributes, which are characteristics of the bibliographic record, such as ISBN or Title. Line items also contain copy information, price information, notes, and alerts.

.Line Item Worksheet
The Line Item Worksheet is designed to be a printable sheet that contains details about the line item, including alerts, notes, number of holds, and distribution information. The system fills in the worksheet as a line item goes through the acquisitions process. This worksheet can be placed in an item that is sent to cataloguing or processing.

The worksheet can be printed by CTRL+P.

.Link to the Catalog
You can link a line item on a selection list to a corresponding MARC record in the catalogue.

The link to catalog option enables you to search for a matching record and link the line item to it. The catalogue record replaces the record originally used to create the line item. When bibliographic records and copies are loaded into the catalogue the copies are attached to the linked record in the catalogue.

The Locate Bib Record search box will appear. By default the search box contains the item's the ISBN, title, and author. Adjust your search terms if necessary.

Your result(s) will appear. If there are no results you will return to the search screen.

Currently the brief bibliographic information does not appear. This is a known bug.

If you are satisfied that the record is for the same item, click Select to link it to the record on the selection list or purchase order.

The line item is now linked to the MARC record in the catalogue. This is the record the holdings will attach to when you Load Bib Records and Items into the catalogue.

.Line Item Batch updater

The Line Item Batch Updater allows line items on purchase orders to have multiple fields batch updated simultaneously.

The following fields can be batch updated:

Copies - this is the total number of copies for the line item, rather than additional copies

Owning Branch

Copy Location

Collection Code

Fund

Circ Modifier

Rather than filling in the same fields every time users can set up Distribution Formulas to use as Line Item Templates.


Fill in the individual fields on the Batch Updater you wish to update or select a Distribution Formula to use.

Select the line items to apply the updates to.

Click Apply to Selected.

Click the Notes link to add notes or line item alerts to the line item.
. Enter a price in the "Estimated Price" field.



Add a Copy to a Line Item
By default, line items have no copies attached to them. If a default number of copies as been specified for the provider, when line items are added to a purchase order copies are automatically added.

Use the Copies link to add copy information to a line item. You can add copies to line items on a selection list or a pending purchase order.

Copies can be added to line items in two ways:

via the Line Item Batch Updater on a purchase order.

via the Copies Screen on a selection list or purchase order.

Copies should not be added once a purchase order has been activated.

Batch Update
Open a purchase order.

Enter the total number of copies for the line item in the Copies field on the Line Item Batch Updater.


The number entered in the Copies field is always the total number of copies for the line item, not the number of copies to add to the selected line item(s).

Click Apply to Selected.

Distribution Formulas can be created by Acquisitions Administrators; see Distribution Formulas.

The zero of the Copies link will update to reflect the number of copies you have created for the line item.






Return to Line Item
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This feature enables you to return to a specific line item on a selection list,
purchase order, or invoice after you have navigated away from the page that
contained the line item.  This feature is especially useful when you must
identify a line item in a long list. After working with a line item, you can
return to your place in the search results or the list of line items.

To use this feature, select a line item, and then, depending on the location of
the line item, click *Return* or *Return to search*.  Evergreen will take you
back to the specific line item in your search and highlight the line item with a
colored box.

For example, you retrieve a selection list, find a line item to examine, and
click the *Copies* link.  After editing the copies, you click *Return*.
Evergreen takes you back to your selection list and highlights the line item
that you viewed.

This feature is available in _General Search Results_, _Purchase Orders_, and
_Selection Lists_, whenever any of the following links are available:

* Selection List
* Purchase Order
* Copies
* Notes
* Worksheet

This feature is available in Invoices whenever any of the following links are
available:

* Title
* Selection List
* Purchase Order

. Count of Existing Copies on Line items
When displaying Acquisitions line items within the Selection List and Purchase Order interfaces, Evergreen displays a count of existing catalog copies on the line item. The count of existing catalog copies refers to the number of copies owned at the ordering agency and / or the ordering agency's child organization units.

The counts display for line items that have a direct link to a catalog record. Generally, this includes line items created as "on order" based on an existing catalog record.

The count of existing copies does not include copies that are in either a Lost or a Missing status.

The existing copy count displays in the link "bar" located below the Order Identifier within the line item.

If no existing copies are found, a "0" (zero) will display in plain text.

If the existing copy count is greater than zero, then the count will display in bold and red on the line item.

.Delete a Line Item
Line items with the status of new, selector-ready, order-ready, or pending-order can be deleted.

Be sure you want to delete the line item as there is no warning message and once deleted line items cannot be un-deleted..

If you created copies for your line items before activating the purchase order you will need to delete the copies from the catalogue before deleting the Acquisitions line item. See Delete Copies

Open a selection list or purchase order.

Check the box(es) of the line item(s) you would like to delete.

Using the main Actions menu, select Actions → Delete Selected Items.

Your line item and the history associated with it will disappear.

.Enhancements to Canceled and Delayed Items
Cancel/Delay reasons have been modified so that you can easily
differentiate between canceled and delayed items.  Each label now begins
with *Canceled* or *Delayed*.  To view the list, click *Administration*
-> *Acquisitions Administration* -> *Cancel Reasons*.

The cancel/delay reason label is displayed as the line item status in the list of line items or as the copy status in the list of copies.

A delayed line item can now be canceled.  You can mark a line item as delayed, and if later, the order cannot be filled, you can change the line item's status to canceled.  When delayed line items are canceled, the encumbrances are deleted.

Cancel/delay reasons now appear on the worksheet and the printable purchase order.

Paid PO Line Items
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Purchase Order line items are marked as "Paid" in red text when all non-cancelled copies on the line item have been invoiced.
