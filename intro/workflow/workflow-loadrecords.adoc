Upload MARC Records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Example 1*
Using the Acquisitions MARC Batch Load interface, upload MARC records to a
selection list and import queue, and match queued records with existing catalog
records.

In this example, an acquisitions librarian has received a batch of MARC records
from a vendor. She will add the records to a selection list and a Vandelay
record queue.

A cataloger will later view the queue, edit the records, and import them into
the catalog.

. Click *Acquisitions -> Load MARC Order Records*
. Add MARC order records to a *Selection list* and/or a *Purchase Order.*
Check the box to create a purchase order if desired.
. Select a *Provider* from the drop-down menu, or begin typing the code for the provider, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Context Org Unit* from the drop down-menu, or begin typing the code
for the context org unit, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Selection List* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the name
of the selection list.  You can create a new list, or the field will auto-fill.
. Create a new record import queue, or upload the records to an existing
queue.
. Select a *Record Match Set*.
. Browse your computer to find the MARC file, and click *Upload*.
. The processed items appear at the bottom of the screen.
. You can click the link(s) to access the selection list or the import queue.
Click the link to *View Selection List*.
. Look at the first line item.  The line item has not yet been linked to the
catalog, but it is linked to a record import queue.  Click the link to the
*queue* to examine the MARC record.
. The batch import interface opens in a new tab.  The bibliographic records
appear in the queue. Records that have matches are identified in the queue. You
can edit these records and/or import them into the catalog, completing the
process.

*Example 2*: Using the Acquisitions MARC Batch Load interface, upload MARC
records to a selection list, and use the Vandelay options to import the records
directly into the catalog.  The Vandelay options will enable you to match
incoming records with existing catalog records.

In this example, a librarian will add MARC records to a selection list, create
criteria for matching incoming and existing records, and import the matching
and non-matching records into the catalog.

. Click *Acquisitions* -> *Load MARC Order Records*
. Add MARC order records to a *Selection list* and/or a *Purchase Order.*
Check the box to create a purchase order if desired.
. Select a *Provider* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the code for the
provider, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Context Org Unit* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the code for the context org unit, and the field will auto-fill.
. Select a *Selection List* from the drop down menu, or begin typing the name
of the selection list.  You can create a new list, or the field will auto-fill.
. Create a new record import queue, or upload the records to an existing queue.
. Select a *Record Match Set*.
. Select *Merge Profile* -> *Match-Only Merge*.
. Check the boxes adjacent to *Import Non-Matching Records* and *Merge on Best
Match*.
.  Browse your computer to find the MARC file, and click *Upload*.
. Click the link to *View Selection List*  Line items that do not match
existing catalog records on title and ISBN contain the link, *link to catalog*.
This link indicates that you could link the line item to a catalog record, but
currently, no match exists between the line item and catalog records.  Line
items that do have matching records in the catalog contain the link, *catalog*.
. Click the *catalog* link to view the line item in the catalog.
