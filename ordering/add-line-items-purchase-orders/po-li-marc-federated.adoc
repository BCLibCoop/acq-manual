The MARC Federated Search enables you to import bibliographic records into a selection list or purchase order 
from a Z39.50 source.


. Go to *Acquisitions* -> *MARC Federated Search*.
. The interface is very similar to the *Import Record from Z39.50* in the cataloguing module.
. Search for our item.  See https://docs.libraries.coop/sitka/_adding_individual_records.html#_searching_via_z39_50[Searching 
via Z39.50] for instructions on performing a Z39.50 search.
. A list of results will appear.
. Check the box beside the desired search result.
. Click *Add to Purchase Order*
. Select your existing purchase order or enter a name for a new one.
. If creating a new purchase order update the Ordering Agency if needed and add a Provider.
. Check the box for Prepayment Required if desired.
. Click *Edit the incoming MARC* if you wish to make changes to the record.
. Click *Continue*.
. A pop-up will appear.  Click *Go to Purchase Order* or *Back to Results*.
