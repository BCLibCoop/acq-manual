In addition to everything you get with Enhanced On Order Records, Shelf Ready Items arrive at your library with their processing done and ready for your patrons to use. When Shelf Ready Items are sent to your library a file of matching full MARC records are sent to the Co-op for loading. These full records include the barcodes for your items. When you physically receive the items all you need to do is check them in and then shelve them.

There are additional costs for Shelf Ready Items
