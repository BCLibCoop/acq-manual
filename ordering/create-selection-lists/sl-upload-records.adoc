in the 901 $c field match. | Generally left unchecked.
|Merge On Single Match | When checked, Evergreen will import records that only have 
one match in the system. | Generally left unchecked.

match as defined by the match score. | This setting should always be checked.

functionality and are similar in look they are used for different purposes.  Libraries

Import Errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
(((load MARC order records, acq import error)))
(((acq import error)))

When loading records via the _Load MARC Order Records_ screen you may occassionally 
encounter an upload error. Evergreen will indicate the cause of the problem in the 
error message.

Import errors are usually caused by a mismatch between the holdings information in 
the 970 field of the MARC file and the information in Evergreen. 

To resolve these errors you must contact your provider with the information to be updated.
Your provider may supply you with an updated MARC file or you can use a program such as 
MARC Edit to update the holdings information in the file to match what Evergreen 
is expecting.

Anytime you update your shelving location names or fund codes in Evergreen you MUST 
let your providers know about the changes so they can update their templates as well.
