Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) accounts are used to electronically send purchase orders and receive invoices from providers.

NOTE: Currently EDI for Sitka Evergreen has been set up to be used with the following providers:
* United Library Services ULS
* Whitehots

Standard Address Number (SAN)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Standard Address Number (SAN) is a unique 7 digit number that identifies your library. Please contact Sitka Support if your library does not already have a SAN.

For EDI to work your library must have a SAN and each of your providers must supply you with their SAN.
