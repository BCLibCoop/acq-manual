Claiming
--------

Evergreen uses claim policies to compile a list of claim-ready items based on order date.  This list can aid staff when claiming items.  Staff can use Evergreen to track items that have been manually claimed. All claiming is currently manual; electronic claiming is not available

Claim Policies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default claim policy associated with each xref:provider[] is automatically assigned to line items and copies purchased from the provider. The claim policy for a line item can be changed on the purchase order until the line item is received.
