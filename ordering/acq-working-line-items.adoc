anchor:lineitem-price[Estimated Price]

*Estimated Price* - A purchase order will not activate without the Estimated Price 
field filled in for each line item. The price entered into Estimated Price is the 
amount that will be encumbered for the item. It is also the amount that will appear 
in the price field of the copy editor for all copies created from this line item.

anchor:existing-copies[Count of Existing Items]

.Count of Existing Items on Line items
When displaying Acquisitions line items within the Selection 
List and Purchase Order interfaces, Evergreen displays a 
count of existing catalogue items on the line item. The count of 
existing catalogue items refers to the number of items owned 
at the ordering agency and / or the ordering agency's 
child organization units.

* The counts display for line items that have a direct link 
to a catalog record. Generally, this includes line items 
created as "on order" based on an existing catalog record.
** If the existing item count is greater than zero, then 
the count will display in bold and red on the line item.
** If no existing items are found, a "0" (zero) will 
display in plain text.
* The count of existing items does not include 
items that are in either a Lost or a Missing status.

is activated.
