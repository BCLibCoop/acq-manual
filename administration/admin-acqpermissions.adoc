Permissions
-----------

IMPORT_MARC - Using batch importer to create new bib records requires the
IMPORT_MARC permission (same as open-ils.cat.biblio.record.xml.import). If the
permission fails, the queued record will fail import and be stamped with a new
"import.record.perm_failure" import error

IMPORT_ACQ_LINEITEM_BIB_RECORD_UPLOAD -  This allows interfaces leveraging
the batch importer, such as Acquisitions, to create a higher barrier to entry.
This permission prevents users from creating new bib records directly from the
ACQ vendor MARC file upload interface.
