New Features in Evergreen Acquisitions Version 3.9
--------------------------------------------------

Administration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The acquisitions administration interfaces have been updated and in some cases consolidated.

* The four xref:claiming-admin[claiming interfaces] have been consolidated into one tabbed interface.
* xref:_currencies_and_exchange_rates[Currencies and exchange rates] are now a single interface, 
making it easier for libraries to view current exchange rates and for Co-op Support to manage exchange 
rates for different currencies for libraries.
* The xref:_distribution_formulas[distribution forumulas] interface has been re-designed.
* Funding sources, funds, and fund tags have been re-designed and consolidated into a tabbed 
xref:_fund_administration[Fund Administration] interface.
* xref:_creating_funding_sources[Funding sources] now have an active flag so you can mark funding sources that are 
no longer in use as inactive.
