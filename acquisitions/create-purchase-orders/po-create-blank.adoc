When creating a purchase order or editing an existing purchase order, the purchase order name must be unique for the ordering agency.  Evergreen will display a warning dialog to users, if they attempt to create or edit purchase order names that match the names of already existing purchase orders at the same ordering agency. The *Duplicate Purchase Order Name Warning Dialog* includes a link that will open the matching purchase order in a new tab.

.When a duplicate purchase order name is detected, the user may:
* Click *View PO* to view the purchase order with the matching name. The purchase order will open in a new tab.
* Click *Cancel* to cancel the creation of the new purchase order.
* Within the _Name (optional)_ field, enter a different, unique name for the new purchase order.
** If the purchase order name is unique for the ordering agency, the user will continue filling in the remaining fields and click *Save*.
** If the purchase order name is not unique for the ordering agency, the Save button will remain grayed out to the user until the purchase order is given a unique name.

.To change the name of an existing purchase order:
. Within the purchase order, the _Name_ of the purchase order is a link (located at the top left-hand side of the purchase order). Click the PO Name.
. A new window will open, where users can rename the purchase order.
. Enter the new purchase order name.
. Click *OK*.

NOTE: Purchase Order Names are case sensitive.
