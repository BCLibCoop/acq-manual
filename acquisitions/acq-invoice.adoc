Invoices
--------

You can create invoices for purchase orders, individual line items, as well as creating blank invoices that charges can be added to. If you are setup for EDI your vendor can send you electronic invoices. If desired, you can create an invoice for items before you receive them. You are able to re-open closed invoices to make adjustments as well as print out all invoices. You can create an invoice to use for direct purchases or to link line items to.

For example, an invoice is received for a shipment with items on purchase order #1 and purchase order #2. When the invoice arrives, purchase order #1 is retrieved, and the invoice is created. Rather than recreate the invoice for purchase order #2 you simply link the purchase order to the invoice.

Use the Link to Invoice for Selected Lineitems menu option to link multiple line items to an invoice that already exists in Evergreen.
