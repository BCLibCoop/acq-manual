Multi vs Single Branch Library_

Decide 


The context org unit is the org unit responsible for placing and managing the order. It defines what org unit settings (eg copy locations) are in scope, what fiscal year to use, who is allowed to view/modify the PO, where the items should be delivered and the EDI
SAN.
Multi-branch system uploading records for multiple branches, choosing the system.
Single branch libraries or branches responsible for their own orders should probably select the branch.
